"""Conflict-free bank mapping: the checker is the authority, the solver must agree with it.

The properties that matter: the checker walks EVERY start address (a sample is not a guarantee);
a mapping z3 returns is one the checker accepts; z3's "unsat" is a proof, so no XOR-fold the
checker accepts may exist when it says so; and the open family's expression evaluator refuses
anything that is not arithmetic over the address.
