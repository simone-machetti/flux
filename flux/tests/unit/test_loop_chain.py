"""The costed chain, stage by stage, with a cutoff between stages (D454).

Every stage is its own pool (a placed number is never compared with a screened one), the cutoff
drops what cannot be the answer and says why, the frontier and finalists choose who climbs, and
the decision is made on the highest stage that produced results.
