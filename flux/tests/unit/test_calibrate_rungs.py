"""The slow stage calibrates the fast one where both measured the same design (D464).

Pins: the ratio per metric comes from the pass's own measurements with spread and count; one
shared design is not enough to claim a bias; the finding reaches the report, the record and the
problem; a correction never rewrites a measurement; a failed calibration does not fail the run.
